			'Of all the things we are nescient of yet still take for granted, the idea that we exert some level of control',
		content: `Intro
	Of all the things we are nescient of yet still take for granted, the idea that we exert some level of control over the superfluity of choices we make on a day to day basis seems to take the crown as most egregiously assumed as a functioning part of our composition. We gain acquaintance with this existence through a diverse many experiences. Beyond sight, hearing, or the great number of emotions we all have on regular occasions; we also seem to experience some level of control over our place in certain intimate events surrounding our lives. This experience of control is so gripping that it just seems so obvious, surely we all have free will. Yet beyond the solemn acquiescence that there are irrefutably factors of this world that we cannot control, there is something to be said about the deeper fundamental experience of free will. The fact is that we don’t really know whether such experiences of existence are painting a true image of how we function within reality or if they are merely disguising nature's unadulterated apathy towards life in any form.
	It seems to be a fairly common conception among advocates of free will that without such a phenomena of existence allowing us to be sovereign over our small corner of reality, we necessarily are reduced to meaningless sacks of meat. In opposition to this idea is where careful thought must be placed to fully understand free will or it’s lack thereof. Because not only is free will likely not contained by life (or any conceptual form of a sentient being), but it is also certainly possible to rightly maintain worth and self fulfillment without it. This of course goes without saying that regardless of how truth makes us feel, it is in no way our place to disregard it.
What is Free Will
	An argument for or against something's existence is completely obsolete if the something being argued is not fully and completely defined. Otherwise the argument has no firm grounding and is destined to be tossed around, misunderstood, in the winds of ambiguity. So let us begin, working up from the absolute bottom there are two essential ideas in need of clarification. First that of free will, using a definition pulled straight from the online oxford english dictionary free will is:
“The power of an individual to make free choices, not determined by divine predestination, the laws of physical causality, fate, etc. Also: the doctrine that human beings possess this power and are hence able to direct and bear responsibility for their own actions” (“Free Will”).
Accordingly free will is the act of making a decision by some entity where post the elimination of all residue of external influences, there still remains some internal non-random influence over the decision. Ranging from some mere inkling of influence to a flexible and completely final influence. “It is the freedom of mind from causal determination”(Caplan). Thus regardless of whether a person is tied down or being threatened with death, if within their head they hold a capacity for decision making of the sort mentioned prior, that is the freedom of will I speak of.
Next is an idea neither simple to define nor facile to harmonize upon, this being the question of the you. The question dealing with the depth of one’s intrinsic claim over existence. For philosophical purposes the idea of the you with regards to how it affects an argument of free will is considerably flexible. Seeing as the argument grounded in philosophy is less concerned with the specifics of the physical (or spiritual) mechanisms that compose the decision making process. But rather the argument is more concerned with how any such mechanism could exist in the first place. It matters not how this freely willed decision comes into being, but rather whether or not a freely willed decision can even come into being.
However a scientific approach to the question of free will does give preference to the you, and for simple reasons. Science aims at uncovering the truth through means of approaching it from as many different angles as is possible. These different angles of course all being recordable and verifiable approaches allowing for thorough analyzing. Because of the proposed nature of a soul, being ethereal and/or invisible, it seems to be completely immeasurable, and as of yet there is no way to measure or collect data on such a thing. Due to this, the inquiry of a soul’s part in freedom of will must go no further than conceptualization. Thus the scientific approach moves forward with the working assumption that the you consists of what we have found to be within one’s head. 
How is Free Will Conceivable
Whenever a choice is made, from a position of free will the thing that is the you has ability to review that decision, and despite any other influences it can choose to influence the decision one way or another. Even if the direction it is influencing the decision is opposite to all other influences, thus truly eliminating all external influences. And regardless of whether this influence has total and final say over the decision or it merely adds to a ‘pot’ of influences, the fact in question is that the you has some distinct influence over the decision being made.
If we assume that the you does have some distinct influence, this means that when you take an action it is caused in some part by the you. Call the whole entity of you A, call the you B, and call the action taken by the object you X. So B causes A to do X. This begs the question what prior cause instigated B to do as such? Well since there is no external cause of B it must be something within B, call that causal force C. Now we have C which causes B in turn causing A to do X. What is C caused by? Again since it can’t be something external to B it must be within B and perhaps it is even within C, call that causal force D. So D causes C which causes B which causes A to do X. This internal causal chain of events that caused B to make A do X will either (1) go on ad infinitum or it will stop somewhere short of that. If it doesn’t go on forever then either (2) we run into the initial cause at B’s inception, or sometime after its inception (3) a cause was pulled by B from the void.
Starting with the third case we get this idea of an uncaused cause. If it is truly uncaused it can be compared to something operating entirely on whim, except on the whim of nothing. Nothing can drive an uncaused cause because it is uncaused.  As Nietzsche put it, “The causa sui” or a causeless cause, “is the best self-contradiction that has ever been conceived, a type of logical rape and abomination” (Nietzsche, Beyond 21). So to take such a phenomena seriously it can only be posed as some sort of randomness wherein the cause is absent,  which again is not counted as free will.
Taking up the second case it’s rather easy to see that this is not any argument for free will. If we take the causal chain of events back to the inception of B, then we clearly can source it to some external causal influence over B. Telling us that the true cause of the influence that B exerts over A is external to and not controlled by  B. As the definition and interpretation of free will stands this clearly does not fit the bill.
The third case seems to grant some modicum of hope for the idea of free will. Seeing that having a causal chain of events occur from nothingness can’t really hold water. It could make sense that the causal factor B itself goes on ad infinitum, just as other causal chains seem to do. However there are some points in need of consideration if one is to accept such an explanation. First that B must exist to some extent independent of the rest of the universe, because it must be that it has never been tainted by any external influences. Thus B will likely be fairly similar, if not exactly the same, as it has always been. It may be conceivable that B has the ability to change itself, but never in response to anything external to itself. Again, in order to maintain the idea of free will there must be no external factor modifying B. Second one must consider the implications that this has on B, or rather the you. In accepting this explanation it means that one, the you has always existed. Two, the you is some similarly congruent form of itself given any other point in time. And three, the you necessarily has no capacity to learn given any experiences.
These conditions may be acceptable enough for some person to accept as a basis of an argument for free will, however there is more to be said of this third case. It seems by accepting the statement that some infinite chain of causal determinants within B leads up to the moment when B causes A to do X (Remember: the you causes you to do something). Previously this infinite chain was slowly being labeled (B>C>D>etc) as different causal factors. However, upon further inspection we see C is actually just some part of B. So it is seen that some part, if not all of B causes B (B>B>B>etc). This argument then falls apart as this is most absurdly appealing to a circular reasoning fallacy.
How is Free Will Empirical
	One way one might try to prove that free will is in fact a thing, if only to themselves, would be through the experience of it. Every single time one is faced with a choice there is a powerful feeling that the you has a influencing hand over the event. Just as we feel physical sensations as matter interacts with our bodies. This seems to be a very strong piece of evidence for free will especially since virtually everyone you encounter will corroborate with you on the matter, saying that they too have the same experience of control over the intimate interactions they have with the world. However we must continually question ourselves to stay vigilant and be on guard against the things that seem true but are really not. Can such a phenomena really be counted as evidence for free will? Even though there are many different cases of the experience of free will, each case is only verified by one person. As the saying goes “The plural of anecdote is not data”. All we really have are many ‘anecdotes’ of this phenomena which all stack up to one very common, unverified, ill documented, experience of something that seems like control. Despite not being very strong evidence for free will, the experience is in itself still evidence, it’s merely extremely weak evidence.
A second point of evidence to consider is through an experiment done by Benjamin Libet. In this experiment it was trying to be found some chronology of the happenings of the brain. To get a picture of this they used an established phenomena of the brain termed the ‘Bereitschaft potential’ or ‘readiness potential’ (RP). RP is an essentially an early and measurable electrical indication that the brain is about to do something, thus acting as an informant as to when a decision to act has been made by the brain. Using RP as a baseline, they would then ask participants to do some action with their arms at intervals up to the participant's discretion, and have the participants notify the researchers when they decided to do the action. To account for the delay in between conscious processing of the action and notification of the action, a control was done were they had the participants respond vocally to stimuli in the arm. The delay was found to be roughly 50ms. They then measured the sequence of RP or the brain's decision to make an action, bear in mind - strictly motor related actions, followed by the conscious perception to make the action. After adjusting the conscious processing by 50ms as found prior, the following timeline shows the results where 0 msec is the occurrence of the action: 
Fig. 1
	It is clear that the conscious desire for an action to be carried out by the body occurs after the rest of the brain has decided it is going to do as much. This being said it cannot be ruled out that the conscious wish has no part in the action. It was explained in the article on the study that as long as the conscious decision happened before 100ms before the action, then it could still play some role in the action. However at this point it seems the only role in decisions potentially played by the conscious would be some sort of vetoing power. Again, it must be kept in mind that the studies done were strictly observing functions of the motor cortex. However a point was made in the article that it is typically normal for effects and measurements of simple systems to hold for the complicated version of those systems. So it still seems as somewhat likely that the same effect could hold for all decisions made in the brain.
	If we do accept that the conscious only has vetoing power over decisions this seems to require a great shift in thinking about free will. In some way of speaking it’s as if a template of thoughts and actions is imposed upon us wherein we only can review each action and determine whether or not we will do it. It must be clarified that we would not have potential to do any action. As in the study a RP was only measured for one moment that was about to occur. It was not as if there was RP for any action presently ‘available’. There was only RP present for the moving of their arm. Thus the variety of options that we feel we can pursue in any given moment would continue to be an illusion of some scale.
Compatibility of Responsibility
	One of the largest realistic consequences of a rejection of free will is that it seems that a rightful sense of responsibility and blame vanishes. The very notion of blame and punishment seems to rest on a responsible agent to solely bear causal claim over its actions.
“Whenever responsibility is assigned, it is usually so that judgment and punishment may follow. Becoming has been deprived of its innocence when any acting-the-way-you-did is traced back to will, to motives, to responsible choices: the doctrine of the will has been invented essentially to justify punishment through the pretext of assigning guilt. All primitive psychology, the psychology of will, arises from the fact that its interpreters, the priests at the head of ancient communities, wanted to create for themselves the right to punish — or wanted to create this right for their God. Men were considered "free" only so that they might be considered guilty — could be judged and punished: consequently, every act had to be considered as willed, and the origin of every act had to be considered as lying within the consciousness” (Nietzsche, Twilight 16).
The only alternative to such a way of treating humanity can only be that any and all blame is not assignable to any human. Because the human acting as cause of some action is just as much victim to the decision as anyone else who can claim shared burden of the consequences to the action. Therefore it may seem that we are in no place to ever respond in accordance with wrongdoing. Yet this need not be the case, because one must merely consider the fact that just as every acting agent, humans have tangible effects on the world and other humans around them. 
This being the case, despite not being able to easily attribute any moral blame upon a person for their actions, we can and should still have ways that we act in response to certain actions. If someone has murdered we should still find it in us to restrain them from doing further harm even if it is not their fault that they do so. Say one were to find a problem computer hopelessly riddled with viruses on a large network of computers. No one would not stop to think if the computer was at fault for being in such a state and it would be absurd to do so. The reasonable response would be to try to stop further harm and then fix the problem at hand, all regardless of the questionable placement of any blame.
Conclusion
	If one agrees with the claim that there is no such thing as free will, then upon first inspection it seems to be a claim of such a profound magnitude that it has a drastic effect on every aspect of life as it is currently perceived. However this is not necessarily the case, for the intimacy of our relationship with reality remains wholly intact. All of the phenomena within existence consistently persists regardless of our ever-shifting paradigm of it. We still have things such as happiness, joy, love, and pleasure to look forward to; as well as things like pain, anger, sadness, or dread. Such facts of our existence continue on having profound effects on our person to some degree beyond mere experiencing. Despite whether or not we have control, in some sense we still clearly have control over tangible factors. Concisely put, it remains that as functioning entities we have control over certain things, we just seem to lack control over our control. Something is controlling our control it just remains to be seen that the controlling force is the you.
Given this non-change in our apparent coexistence with the rest of reality, it similarly remains the case that one should continue to strive for greater things for equivalent reasoning as if that one did have free will. In no way does a lack of free will necessarily equate to a defeated or desolate outlook on life. The essential focal point of this understanding is in the fact that one’s experience remains having an effect on the you, thus it remains logical to strive after those experiences that are pleasurable whilst avoiding those of the  not-so-pleasurable nature.
	After a logical analysis of a conception of free will, it is found that it cannot uphold its own weight. Each branch of argument for the concept necessarily leads into absurdity or merely a lack of true freedom of will. Also after reviewing some of the empirical evidence available on the topic it doesn’t seem to point one in the direction of free will either. Considering these outcomes it seems likely that the fact of the matter is that living organisms do not and cannot exhibit such an ideal grasp on the reality it is contained by. However, despite the falling apart of such a view of one's function; a sense of morality, worth, or responsibility does not likewise break down. We cannot choose the cards we are dealt, but we can find a preeminent way of playing them. It is not our task as existing entities to determine the factors of our existence. We may only do our best at finding the truth of each suspect factor, then find some way within ourselves to continue onward with a superlative praxis.

		content: `Philosophy is hard. Covering the depth and breadth of all branches of philosophy from epistemology to ethics is an enormous task. Prolific writers such as Liebniz or Aristotle who made gigantic contributions to so many different fields are probably going to remain a feature of the past. Doing good philosophy is such a challenge we find ourselves in a world where Ph.D scholars may spend a lifetime focusing on a very limited set of subjects yet still risk philosophical failure1. Consequently, we find ourselves in a world in which even senior undergrad or master’s level philosophy students hesitate to engage in current political, religious, or ethical discussions.

This status quo isn’t necessarily bad. However, I don’t think anyone should abstain from modern day discussions because they lack perfectly sound arguments or an oeuvre that includes works on par with the Theodicy. So long as myself, and others, are willing to stick to the rules of civil discussion there is no reason that we cannot engage with even the most difficult philosophical discussions. 

All of this is to say that I will be producing short essays rather than long ones. They will be often incomplete rather than complete. These essays will try to stick to a concise topic, even if I can’t immediately substantiate everything I say with thorough arguments and complete evidence. This will mean that my papers will become better over time as I release additional supporting papers or citations. While this system does have some large downsides I think it will allow people to engage with me in a living breathing philosophical process; this is a benefit that should outweigh all the problems with such a dynamic system. Additionally, since these essays will be updated overtime, I plan on keeping a public archive of previous versions. I also plan on publicly crediting, within the archive, individuals who may lead me to change my beliefs or consider new ideas. And so, I personally invite you to read my work and to critically engage with my thoughts and ideas.
